# Just Be Who You Wanna Be
## Hi! Here is ProgramRipper!
Actually, My English name is `Bryan`. But please call me `ProgramRipper` or abbr `PR` when talking about code, especially on GitHub.

If you have any problem about code, contact me by [ProgramRipper@foxmail.com](mailto:ProgramRipper@foxmail.com).

If you want to know more about me, please read on! 

## Code for fun!
I am a Chinese freshman. Learning code as a hobby.

If you love something more than my code, you can find me under the name `Bryan不可思议` on other platforms, such as [QQ](https://qm.qq.com/cgi-bin/qm/qr?k=h60CBLMAtBE5GBkNndi59m8H74tTA2qa&noverify=0), [BiliBili](https://space.bilibili.com/160148624) (well...this BiliBili account has been banned forever, please contact [this account](https://space.bilibili.com/1087319369) instead) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ProgramRipper).

Welcome to be my friend not only on GitHub but also on these platforms.
